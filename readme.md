User story: 

As a web-editor, I want to be able to drop a component onto a page which will dynamically search for related content within the CMS and display it in list format, underneath a pre-defined header and text.

-----------------------------------------

Functional requirements:

 - Create a dynamic Episerver 'search' component which can be customised and dropped into the homepage
 - Component should be customised with the following CMS-editable properties
    - Title (h1 header)
	- Precis (paragraph text)
	- Search string (one-line text)
 - The component should perform a search within existing Episerver content and retrieve pages which match the predefined 'Search' string in title or content. Search result data should be output in a simple unordered list.
